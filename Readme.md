# Switcher Active Window Manager

Supercharged Alt-Tab window manager that handles windows on multiple monitors
and multiple desktops. Allows more detailed window control vs the built-in
Alt-Tab tool on windows.

When activated on a monitor the list of windows appear. Their window state, on-top, 
desktop and monitor locations are shown as well. Each of the icons can be clicked to change the state.
